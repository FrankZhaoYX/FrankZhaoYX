<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Yixi Zhao</h1>

👋 Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Yixi.  
🎓 I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from York University and am currently pursuing a thesis-based Master’s in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.  
📈 My journey into data engineering began during my first co-op with the Data Automation team at Blackberry, where I was introduced to cloud technologies and big data experience that helped define my career goals.

🏋️ Outside of tech, I’m an amateur CrossFit athlete. Follow my journey on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/frankzhao0306/).
