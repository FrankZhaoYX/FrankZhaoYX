<h2 align="center">👋 Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Yixi. </h2> 
🎓 I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from York University and am currently pursuing a thesis-based Master’s in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.  
📈 My journey into data engineering began during my first co-op with the Data Automation team at Blackberry, where I was introduced to cloud technologies and big data experience that helped define my career goals.
